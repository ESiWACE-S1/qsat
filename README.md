# Thermodynamics in DALES

## Motivation

The current implementation of the thermodynamics equations in DALES take a lot of CPU time.
This repository will compare the current equations with a few alternative implementations,
primarily to compare the accuarcies.
The intent is to then port the fastest and accurate-enough one to DALES.
